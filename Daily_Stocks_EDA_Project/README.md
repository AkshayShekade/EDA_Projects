## Executive Summary:

- This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Daily Stock Prices and Returns datasets.
- By analyzing daily stock prices and returns for companies such as Apple, JP Morgan Chase, Procter & Gamble, and United Airlines, we can identify trends, patterns, and correlations.
- The insights gained from this analysis can help in making informed investment decisions and understanding market behaviour.
